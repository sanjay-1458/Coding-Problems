You are given an integer mountainHeight denoting the height of a mountain.

You are also given an integer array workerTimes representing the work time of workers in seconds.

The workers work simultaneously to reduce the height of the mountain. For worker i:

To decrease the mountain's height by x, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x seconds. For example:
To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds.
To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on.
Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.

This solution uses two levels of binary search. The inner binary search occurs inside the helper function that, for each value in the input array, finds the largest possible integer height that does not make the quadratic expression exceed a given time limit. This inner binary search runs in logarithmic time with respect to the target height. The outer binary search seeks the minimum number of seconds required so that the sum of these heights meets or exceeds the specified target. As a result, for each candidate time, it checks the entire array using the inner search, making the overall time complexity roughly O(n log(ht) log(sec)), where n is the number of array elements, ht is the target height, and sec is the estimated range of seconds.

```cpp []
class Solution {
    bool valid(long long sec,vector<int>&nums,long long ht){
        int n=nums.size();
        long long ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i){
            long long curr=nums[i];
            long long low=1,high=ht;
            while(low<=high){
                long long height=(high-low)/2+low;
                if((height*height+height)*nums[i]<=sec*2){
                    low=height+1;
                }
                else{
                    high=height-1;
                }
            }
            ans+=high;
        }
        return ans>=ht;
    }
public:
    long long minNumberOfSeconds(int mH, vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        long long ht=mH;
        int mini=*min_element(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        long long high=((ht*ht+ht)*mini)/2+1;
        long long low=1;
        while(low<=high){
            long long sec=(high-low)/2+low;
            if(valid(sec,nums,ht)){
                high=sec-1;
            }
            else{
                low=sec+1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
};
