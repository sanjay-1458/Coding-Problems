## Approach and Solution

### Theory Behind the Approach:

This problem is based on the following key concepts:

1. **Prefix Sum**: A prefix sum is a sequence derived from an array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of all elements from index `0` to `i-1` in the original array. This helps in efficiently calculating the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: Kadane’s Algorithm is a famous dynamic programming technique used to find the maximum sum of a subarray in linear time. The algorithm maintains a running sum (`current_sum`) and updates the global maximum (`max_sum`) as it iterates through the array.

3. **Sliding Window Technique with Divisibility Constraint**: The added complexity in this problem is the requirement that the subarray length must be divisible by `k`. To address this, we calculate prefix sums and use a sliding window to keep track of subarrays whose lengths are divisible by `k`.

### Solution Explanation:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: First, we compute the prefix sum array `pre` where `pre[i]` contains the sum of the first `i` elements from the `nums` array. This allows us to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. **Sliding Window**: We then iterate over possible subarrays with lengths divisible by `k`. For each starting point `i` (from 1 to `k`), we select subarrays of length `k`, `2k`, `3k`, etc. This ensures that the subarray length is divisible by `k`.

3. **Kadane’s Algorithm**: For each subarray, we use a variation of Kadane’s algorithm to calculate the maximum subarray sum. We maintain a running sum and reset it to zero when it becomes negative, which is typical in Kadane's algorithm.

4. **Final Answer**: The result is the maximum value obtained from all the subarrays that satisfy the divisibility constraint.

### Code Implementation (C++):

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n=nums.size();
        vector<long long> pre(n+1,0);
        for(int i=1;i<=n;++i){
            pre[i]=pre[i-1]+nums[i-1];
        }
        long long ans=LONG_MIN;
        for(int i=1;i<=k;++i){
            vector<long long> curr;
            for(int j=i+k-1;j<=n;j+=k){
                long long x=pre[j];
                if(j-k>=0){
                    x-=pre[j-k];
                }
                curr.push_back(x);
            }
            long long sum=0;
            for(auto &x:curr){
                sum+=x;
                ans=max(ans,sum);
                if(sum<0) sum=0;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
